## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Spaced Repetition engine logic for Flashcards (`SuperMemo SM-2` adaptation).
- Redux slices for global user auth state and request handling.
- PDF and text processing pipelines in Express backend.
- Security headers via `helmet` middleware (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, etc.).
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (login 10/15min, register 5/hr, forgot-password 5/hr, refresh 10/15min).
- Input validation middleware via `express-validator` for auth routes.
- Startup validation: server exits if `JWT_SECRET` is not defined.
- Request body size limiting to 10KB.
- Restricted CORS origin via `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable.
- **Email verification**: New users must verify email before logging in. Registration sends verification link with 24-hour expiry. `POST /api/auth/verify-email/:token` endpoint.
- **Forgot / Reset password**: Real crypto-random tokens (hashed with SHA-256 in DB) with 1-hour expiry. `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` and `POST /api/auth/reset-password/:token` endpoints.
- **Refresh token rotation**: Long-lived 7-day refresh tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes. Each refresh invalidates the old token and issues a new pair. `POST /api/auth/refresh-token` endpoint.
- **Nodemailer email service**: `backend/services/emailService.js` — sends via SMTP when configured (`SMTP_HOST`), falls back to console logging for dev/test.
- **Password complexity rules**: Minimum 8 characters, requires uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character.
- `isEmailVerified` field on User model to gate login access.

### Changed
- **JWT access token lifetime reduced from 30 days to 15 minutes** for improved security. Refresh tokens provide long-lived sessions.
- **Registration response**: No longer returns a JWT token. Returns `{ success, message, isEmailVerified: false }` prompting email verification.
- **Login response**: Returns 403 `Forbidden` if email is not verified. Returns `refreshToken` alongside `token` for session management.
- **User model**: Password `minlength` increased from 6 to 8. Added 7 new fields (`isEmailVerified`, `emailVerificationToken`, `emailVerificationExpire`, `resetPasswordToken`, `resetPasswordExpire`, `refreshTokens`, `refreshTokenExpire`). Added `generateToken(field)` instance method for crypto token generation.
- **Rate limit thresholds adjusted**: Login 5→10/15min, Register 3→5/hr, Forgot-password 3→5/hr (to accommodate legitimate use after verification requirement).

### Fixed
- Intermittent CORS issues when connecting Vite local server to Node.js backend.
- Token expiration handling inside the Redux Thunk loader.
- **Security**: Removed hardcoded JWT fallback secret `supersecret_openprep_key` from `middleware/auth.js` and `controllers/authController.js`. JWT secret must now come exclusively from the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable.
- **Forgot password stub**: `forgotPassword` previously returned fake `{ success: true, data: {} }` with no actual functionality. Now generates real crypto tokens and sends email.
- **Dashboard weekly chart data**: `getDashboardStats` and `getStudyHours` now query Progress records from the last 7 calendar days (aggregated by date) instead of fetching the last 7 arbitrary records. Missing days are filled with zero values instead of hardcoded demo data. (#125)
